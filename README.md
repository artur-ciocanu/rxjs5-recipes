This repository contains a few RxJS 5 recipes that I've found useful in my day to day job.

For now we have only these two:

1. task-queue - it creates a task queue that allows you to add tasks and ensures that taks will be executed sequentially and it will progress even on task error
2. execute-recursive - is a really "dumb" example that shows how we can use RxJS ```expand``` operator to execute something recursively

Tests and more examples TBD
